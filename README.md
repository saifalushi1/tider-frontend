<h1>Tider</h1>

<p>Tider is a reddit clone built using next.js, django, and postgres.

I use reddit peronsally for news, gaming, new shows, etc... So I wanted to give it a shot at building my own version.</p>

<br />

<p>This project was also my capstone project for GA and although I had some bumps in the road Im pretty proud as to how it came out. </p>
